# Typing-Tutor
Typing is the basic command to run a computer and your typing speed plays vital role while working in computer to save time.
Here I have presented a Typing Tutor to measure userâ€™s typing speed and to enhance their typing speed.

It will be a simple command line program.
Features:

1.Calculate the accuracy of the user.
2.Calculate the speed of the user.
3.Helps in increasing the typing speed of the user.
4.It is different from other typing tutor programs as words will fall and user has to type the word before it falls completely.
5.It will have different levels starting from 1 to 10. 
6.As the level will increase the falling speed of words will also increase.
7.It can also show the previous statistics and show the improvement rate.
